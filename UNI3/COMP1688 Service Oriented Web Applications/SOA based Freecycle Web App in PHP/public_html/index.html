This file is called <span class="tty">index.html</span> and is a placeholder for your account on the Apache web (HTTP) server called <span class="tty">stuweb.cms.gre.ac.uk</span> provided by the University of Greenwich for students in the Department of Computing.
You may find it useful to bookmark this page in your web browser.

<p>The <span class="tty">stuweb.cms.gre.ac.uk</span> web server mounts the <span class="tty">public_html</span> directory of your Unix file system provided by the University of Greenwich.
The simplest way to access this file system is to use the Unix server called <span class="tty">student.cms.gre.ac.uk</span> .
Please note that this Unix server is called <span class="tty">student.cms.gre.ac.uk</span> whereas the HTTP server is called <span class="tty">stuweb.cms.gre.ac.uk</span>.
You have SSH and SFTP access to this server from anywhwere on the Internet.
</p><p>
Any secure shell such as <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> can be used to log onto to this server.
Any FTP client, for example <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> or <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, can be used to transfer files to and from this server.
Better still, a text editor with a built-in FTP client, such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/">Archnophilia</a> or even <a href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>, will enable you to edit your files directly on the server.
All of this software can run on a Microsoft Windoze platform and is available free of charge.
If you are fortunate enough to be using a Mac or Linux machine you may find that most, if not all of the tools you require to create a website running from <span class="tty">stuweb.cms.gre.ac.uk</span> are already installed.
</p><p>
Further guidance on using this web server is available from our <a href="http://labs.cms.gre.ac.uk/web/stuweb.asp">Student Technical Support</a>.
Please note that file names, file paths and URLs on these servers are all case sensitive.
You will have more manageable URLs if you keep your file names short and avoid including spaces in file and directory names.
